Questions
*********

* Do I understand this guide well enough to set up a
  new project from memory?

* What is code coverage?

  How much of your source code is executed while
  running its test suite.

* Pyenv is super frustrating. How can I install
  multiple versions of python for matrix testing with
  Nox?
