Questions
*********

* Do I understand this guide well enough to set up a
  new project from memory?

* What is code coverage?

  The percentage of your source code that is exercised by the test suite.

* Pyenv is super frustrating. How can I install
  multiple versions of python for matrix testing with
  Nox?

* I can't get Nox to work. I've tried installing it with pip on the host,
  installing it with pipx, installing it as a os-level package in a toolbox
  container, and installing it with devbox.
